This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to handling null and undefined values.  The 'bug.js' file contains code that correctly handles these values using strict equality (===).  This is important to avoid unexpected behavior, particularly when using loose comparisons (==). The 'bugSolution.js' file is identical to 'bug.js' in this case, as the original code was already correctly handling null and undefined.
